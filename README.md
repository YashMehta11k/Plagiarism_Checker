# Plagiarism_Checker
The project involves building a plagiarism detector for text files using binary classification. Detecting plagiarism is challenging due to subtle differences between paraphrased answers and original work.
Files and their roles:
1. source_sklearn
    - `train.py`: It is the training script which will be executed when the model is trained and it contains the necessary code to train our model.
2. Plagiarism_data.ipynb - It is a jupyter notebook which contains the necessary code to explore the plagiarism data.
3. Plagiarism_Training - It is a jupyter notebook which contains the necessary code to create, train and deploy the model in SageMaker.
4. helpers.py - It is the script which contains all the helper functions used during the entire project (refered from some models)
5. data - Contains all the token classified files to make and predict the model
